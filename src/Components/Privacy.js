            <p className="gray-color">Personal Information You Provide to Us:</p>
            <p>We may receive and store any information you submit to the Application (or otherwise authorize us to obtain –

            <p>We receive and store certain types of usage related information whenever you interact with Application. For example,
              Khaleef Technologies may automatically receive and record information regarding your computer&rsquo;s IP address,
              browser information, Facebook user ID, Facebook Page fan status, and URLs accessed. Such information may be
  shared in aggregate (non-personally identifiable) form with our partners.</p>

            <hr />
            <p className="gray-color">HOW DOES Khaleef Technologies USE THE INFORMATION IT COLLECTS?</p>
            <p>Khaleef Technologies uses the information described in this Privacy Statement (i) internally, to analyze, develop
              and improve its products and services, and (ii) as set forth below in the "Will Khaleef Technologies
  Share any of the personal information it Collects&rdquo; section below.</p>
            <hr />
            <p className="gray-color">APPLICATION PARTNER TREATMENT OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.</p>
            <p>Khaleef Technologies may provide personal information to the applicable Application Partner. The Application
              Partner&rsquo;s use of your personal information is subject to the Application Partner&rsquo;s separate privacy
              policy – and not this Privacy Statement. The Application Partner&rsquo;s privacy policy is linked to from within
  the Partner&rsquo;s Facebook application.</p>
            <hr />
            <p className="gray-color">WILL Khaleef Technologies SHARE ANY OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION IT RECEIVES?</p>
            <p>Personal information about our users is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your personal
              information to anyone (with the exception of sharing your information with an applicable Application Partner
              – see the "Application Partner Treatment&rdquo; section above). We share your personal information only
  as described below.</p>
            <p>
                <span className="gray-color">Application Partners:</span> We will share your personal information with an applicable Application Partner
  (see the "Application Partner Treatment&rdquo; section above).</p>
            <p>
                <span className="gray-color">Agents:</span> We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information
                with them to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, Khaleef Technologies&rsquo;s
                agents do not have any right to use personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist
                us. You hereby consent to our sharing of personal information for the above purposes. Business Transfers: In
                some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically
                one of the business assets that are transferred. Moreover, if Khaleef Technologies, or substantially all of
                its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Khaleef Technologies goes out of business or enters
                bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You
                acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Khaleef Technologies may continue to use
  your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
            <p>
                <span className="gray-color">Protection of Khaleef Technologies and Others:</span> We may release personal information when we believe in
                good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other
                agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Khaleef Technologies, our employees, our users, or
                others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and
  credit risk reduction.</p>
            <p>
                <span className="gray-color">With Your Consent:</span> Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your personal information may
  be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.</p>
